Paul Buchheit - YC

Technology : patterns in your head. Change your patterns 

1 - I do not anything

No experience favorites 

Good ideas look like bad ideas 
. 1997 - Google tried to sell for 1M$

Escaping dogmatism

2 - Kill all daemon processes

Remove the noise, be free and work without distraction.

Find calm and clear mind. 

3 - Fight and step back

Uber turned 

Best things come from the worst events.

4 - Choose the more interesting path

Justin.tv at the beg. was a camera attached to the head of Justin.
Twitch

Predective uncertainty. 

Success = learning something

5 - Love what you do 

Forget about the goal and love what your are doing now. 

Love unpleasant moments through meaning. 

6 - Maintain a healthy disregard for the impossible

Fail at awesome / Win at something low.

Startups are fueled by self interest. 

We do not need more jobs, we need more steve's jobs.
